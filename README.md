The best project for help.
Steps:
1. firstly we need to open GitHub with our project https://github.com/Ukrainer-In-Trier/ukrainer-in-trier
2. I choose Fork and named dokercomandir/ukrainer-in-trier
3. Put the button "code" and copied SSH: git@github.com:dokercomandir/ukrainer-in-trier.git
4. open terminal (I used PoweShell (Windows)) 
5. input command: git clone git@github.com:dokercomandir/ukrainer-in-trier.git to create new folder with our project
6. input command: git status to check the files
7. transfer to create hugo site: in the terminal in the same path where we create our project (my path C:\Users\DELL\projects\ukrainer-in-trier>) we need to write the command: hugo new site ukrainer-in-trier
8. later we need to follow with the tutorial on installing the theme
9. next I deleted .git folder from hugos folders (with site's components and theme's components). left onli .git from our project
10. write the command to add new files in our project: git add .  
11. check the status: git status
12. next: git commit -m "First commit"
The terminal asked me authorise my e-mail and my name. I wrote two command: 
  git config --global user.email "dokercomandir@example.com"
  git config --global user.name "Ruslan"
13. next step: git push git@github.com:dokercomandir/ukrainer-in-trier.git
