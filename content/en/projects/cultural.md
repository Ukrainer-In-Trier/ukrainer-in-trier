      School

    {{< cultural-item-text >}}
      Children should have access to the same lives as their peers in Ukraine. Many of them will return home - that's why our 
      task is to make a minimal "gap" in knowledge. And school is a great opportunity for children to communicate with each 
      other.

      Use new changes as additional opportunities! Learn German, try yourself in a new profession - master new skills. In the 
      future - it will be very useful.

      Library

    {{< cultural-item-text >}}
      Ukrainian library. This is a mystery. A treasure house of all knowledge. Whether a child or an adult, everyone should
      have the opportunity to immerse themselves in the world of their hobbies in their native language. You need to learn 
      German, but you also need to relax!

    {{< cultural-item-text >}}
      We hold various events. As much as possible in a "family", such a native atmosphere. Evening parties, picnics, walks 
      around the city - we implement all this thanks to our incredible Ukrainians.
