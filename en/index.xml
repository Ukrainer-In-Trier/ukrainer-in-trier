The history of our project begins with a burning desire, or rather with several desires:
Provide help and support to those who remained in their native land!
Do not stay away from the war! Protect the rear! Strengthen the information front!
And the idea was born to demonstrate to the world what Ukraine is, how beautiful and multifaceted it is.
Fall in love with our Motherland because of its greatest treasures: sincere freedom-loving people, original traditions, folklore, experience!</description></item><item><title>Art space / art</title><link>https://www.ukrainer-in-trier.com/en/projects/art/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ukrainer-in-trier.com/en/projects/art/</guid><description> We create exhibitions, historical props.

Why are we saying this? Because only such people and companies cannot stand aside when people are suffering. When you have principles, you have your own thoughts and your own views. If you are willing to sacrifice your own piece of bread for others who cannot buy it. Thank you for supporting us! For believing in our projects and helping to implement them.</description></item><item><title>Psychological help</title><link>https://www.ukrainer-in-trier.com/en/projects/psych-help/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ukrainer-in-trier.com/en/projects/psych-help/</guid><description>No one deserve to experience grief, pain and despair alone. Sometimes it's just as hard for others. And it seems that there is no one to share your worries and anxieties with. Because it's bad for everyone. Because I'm afraid to get bored. Many different "Because".
But a person needs a person, the one who can withstand the storm of emotions, difficult and unpleasant.
And a psychologist can become such a person.</description></item><item><title>Ukrainian cultural center</title><link>https://www.ukrainer-in-trier.com/en/projects/cultural/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ukrainer-in-trier.com/en/projects/cultural/</guid><description>Ukrainian cultural center Together we create a new story and preserve the old one! + School Children should have access to the same lives as their peers in Ukraine.
