The history of our project begins with a burning desire, or rather with several desires:
Provide help and support to those who remained in their native land!
Do not stay away from the war! Protect the rear! Strengthen the information front!
And the idea was born to demonstrate to the world what Ukraine is, how beautiful and multifaceted it is.
Fall in love with our Motherland because of its greatest treasures: sincere freedom-loving people, original traditions, folklore, experience!</description></item></channel></rss>
